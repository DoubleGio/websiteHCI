      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
          ADAM &amp; AOKI is on a mission to make clothes smarter.<br>
          For thousands of years we’ve focused on practically in clothing and that time has come to an end.<br>
          It’s time to start wearing clothes that not only look and feel great, but also help us to overcome everyday challenges like sunburn.<br>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
          We believe that as a business, our aim should be to try to make the world a better place.<br>
          That’s why our vision is to produce sustainable smart clothing on a global scale that is specially designed to help solve millions of real-world problems, each and every day.<br>
          <strong>#changeit.</strong> If you’re unhappy or upset with something, be the agent of change.<br>
          <strong>Transparency.</strong> No good ever came of lies and secrecy. Just ask Romeo &amp; Juliet.<br>
          <strong>Doing good.</strong> Solving real world problems is what gets us out of bed in the morning and we’d like to keep it thatway.<br>
          <strong>Persevere.</strong> Let’s agree to never give up on our individual and shared challenges.<br>
          <strong>Sustainability.</strong> We ❤ planet earth, but for it to keep being planet earth we need to take care of it.<br>

      <h2>What makes us ADAM &amp; AOKI</h2>
      <p>
          <strong>Focus on priorities and prioritise focus.</strong> All the unimportant stuff can wait.<br>
          <strong>Being busy is a mindset.</strong> You’re never too busy to do something. You just didn’t make time for it and that’s fine with us.<br>
          <strong> Be forever flexibile.</strong> If a 90 year old can do the splits what’s your excuse?<br>
          <strong>Have Fun.</strong> Nothing —and we really mean nothing —should be boring. Including socks.<br>
          <strong>Stay Curious.</strong> They say curiosity killed the cat but we promise it won’t kill you. Quite the opposite in fact.<br>
          <strong>Sharing.</strong> We think you’re amazing and we genuinely mean it. Only thing we ask is that you share your amazingness with everyone around you.

        <p>
            Back in the day I was a terrible teen, running riot.<br>
            Football and females were pretty much my only interest, despite my parents best attempts to convince me it might be worth listening in school.<br>

        <p>
            Fortunately I was - and luckily still am - surrounded by some amazing people.<br>
            My Grandparents, who lived through WWII, were always on hand valuable and candid advice.<br>
            My brother Ben, who has more often that not been a voice of reason.<br>
            And there was Gerry, one of my mother’s best friend and an unofficial mentor to me.<br>

          <h2>Gerry and his influence</h2>
          <p>
              I admired Gerry from the get go.<br>
              A gentlemen, championing the fight against important causes like elder abuse and gay rights, and an unintended comedy genius.<br>
              He was once at a ceremony with the then president Bill Clinton, and beamed as he told how he was close enough to take great photos.<br>
              He couldn’t wait to get them developed. Only problem was he’d forgotten to put film in his camera.<br>

        <h2>Risk factors of UV rays</h2>
        <p>
            One of the first times I met him he parked his car in central London a spot that probably wasn’t meant to be parked in.<br>
            Having stepped out the car, he walked over to the ticket machine.<br>
            A few buttons later, the machine broke and spat out a bunch of pound coins but no ticket.<br>
            He proclaimed that he thought “it would probably be ok” and proceeded to give me the change.<br>
            The act typified his unselfishness.<br>
            Sadly Gerry died of cancer in 2013.<br>
            As a young man he had skin cancer (melanoma), developed from too much skin damage acquired from excessive sunbathing.<br>
            Even though he beat skin cancer a young man, he died of lung cancer — which was caused by melanoma cancer cells that had remained from his first battle with cancer.<br>
